 * This code displays animated GIFs on a 64x16 RGB LED display. 
 * It was used to operate an LED Top Hat: https://imgur.com/gallery/6iKDv 
 * 
 * Minor modifications by: Matthew Varas
 * 
 * The program is based on previous modifications to the SmartMatrix3 "Animated GIFs" sketch.
 * Original modifications were by performed by Louis Beaudoin to adapt the sketch to the 
 * WS2812 NeoPixel using the Adafruit NeoPixel library. https://github.com/pixelmatix/animatedgifs/tree/neopixel 
 * 
 * Additional References: https://learn.adafruit.com/smartmatrix-animated-gif-player/overview 
 * 
 * The required additional libraries for the project are: 
 *    Adafruit_NeoPixel
 *    Adafruit_GFX
 *    Adafruit_NeoMatrix
 * 
 * 
 * The 64x16 top hat project used four 16x16 WS2812 RGB LED Matricies. The code was modified
 * to adjust for the different pixel layout and aspect ratio. All other code is original to 
 * the previous projects. 
 * 
 * The sketch is run on a Teensy 3.6 via TeensyDuino with gifs loaded on a microSD card in the /gifs/ folder.
 * A SmartMatrix 4 shield was used for the serial breakout connector and level shifting. Note that the 
 * WS2812 is expecting a 5V data signal and the Teensy is 3.3V. While my testing showed that it would
 * still behave with a 3.3V signal, level shifting up to 5V is strongly recommended.
 * The WS2812 uses a one-wire serial protocol which was connected to Pin 17 because it is the 
 * data out line on the SmartMatrix 4 shield.
 * 
 * GIF file names must be 8 characters or less and end in .gif
 * 
 *  
 *  Two buttons were added to adjust output brightness. These are pretty poorly implemented due
 *  to lack of time, but they do function. Debounce is handled within the interrupt (hence "poorly
 *  implemented"). Buttons are active low and use the internal pull-up's in the MCU instead of 
 *  external resistors. 
 *  
 *  Pinouts: 
 *  Serial Data: Pin 17
 *  Brightness Up: Pin 5
 *  Brightness Down: Pin 4
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  Gif files must be 64x16 pixels to be properly handled. This matches the original number of
 *  LED's (1024). I'm unsure if the code will work with any other total number of LED's.
 *  In order to change to a different pixel configuration the "Width" and "Height" 
 *  constants in "GIFParseFunctions.cpp" need to be updated to the correct dimensions. 
 *  Additionally, in this file the line that reads "Adafruit_NeoMatrix strip..." 
 *  must be updated to reflect the size of the matricies used as well as the tile configuration. 
 *  Examples of this can be found in the "tiletest" example from the Adafruit Neomatrix library. 
 *  
 *  A description of the matrix declaration from the tiletest example: 
 *  
 *  // MATRIX DECLARATION:
// Parameter 1 = width of EACH NEOPIXEL MATRIX (not total display)
// Parameter 2 = height of each matrix
// Parameter 3 = number of matrices arranged horizontally
// Parameter 4 = number of matrices arranged vertically
// Parameter 5 = pin number (most are valid)
// Parameter 6 = matrix layout flags, add together as needed:
//   NEO_MATRIX_TOP, NEO_MATRIX_BOTTOM, NEO_MATRIX_LEFT, NEO_MATRIX_RIGHT:
//     Position of the FIRST LED in the FIRST MATRIX; pick two, e.g.
//     NEO_MATRIX_TOP + NEO_MATRIX_LEFT for the top-left corner.
//   NEO_MATRIX_ROWS, NEO_MATRIX_COLUMNS: LEDs WITHIN EACH MATRIX are
//     arranged in horizontal rows or in vertical columns, respectively;
//     pick one or the other.
//   NEO_MATRIX_PROGRESSIVE, NEO_MATRIX_ZIGZAG: all rows/columns WITHIN
//     EACH MATRIX proceed in the same order, or alternate lines reverse
//     direction; pick one.
//   NEO_TILE_TOP, NEO_TILE_BOTTOM, NEO_TILE_LEFT, NEO_TILE_RIGHT:
//     Position of the FIRST MATRIX (tile) in the OVERALL DISPLAY; pick
//     two, e.g. NEO_TILE_TOP + NEO_TILE_LEFT for the top-left corner.
//   NEO_TILE_ROWS, NEO_TILE_COLUMNS: the matrices in the OVERALL DISPLAY
//     are arranged in horizontal rows or in vertical columns, respectively;
//     pick one or the other.
//   NEO_TILE_PROGRESSIVE, NEO_TILE_ZIGZAG: the ROWS/COLUMS OF MATRICES
//     (tiles) in the OVERALL DISPLAY proceed in the same order for every
//     line, or alternate lines reverse direction; pick one.  When using
//     zig-zag order, the orientation of the matrices in alternate rows
//     will be rotated 180 degrees (this is normal -- simplifies wiring).
//   See example below for these values in action.
// Parameter 7 = pixel type flags, add together as needed:
//   NEO_RGB     Pixels are wired for RGB bitstream (v1 pixels)
//   NEO_GRB     Pixels are wired for GRB bitstream (v2 pixels)
//   NEO_KHZ400  400 KHz bitstream (e.g. FLORA v1 pixels)
//   NEO_KHZ800  800 KHz bitstream (e.g. High Density LED strip)

 /*
  * This example displays 32x32 GIF animations loaded from a SD Card connected to the Teensy 3.1
  * The GIFs must be 32x32 pixels exactly
  * Wiring is on the default Teensy 3.1 SPI pins, and chip select can be on any GPIO,
  * set by defining SD_CS in the code below
  * Function     | Pin
  * DOUT         |  11
  * DIN          |  12
  * CLK          |  13
  * CS (default) |  15
  *
  * This code first looks for .gif files in the /gifs/ directory
  * (customize below with the GIF_DIRECTORY definition) then plays random GIFs in the directory,
  * looping each GIF for DISPLAY_TIME_SECONDS
  *
  * This example is meant to give you an idea of how to add GIF playback to your own sketch.
  * For a project that adds GIF playback with other features, take a look at
  * Light Appliance:
  * https://github.com/CraigLindley/LightAppliance
  *
  * If you find any 32x32 GIFs that won't play properly, please attach them to a new
  * Issue post in the GitHub repo here:
  * https://github.com/pixelmatix/AnimatedGIFs/issues
  *
  * This sketch requires the SdFat Library: https://github.com/greiman/SdFat
  *
  * If you're having trouble compiling this sketch, view instructions in the README file, which is
  * available online here: https://github.com/pixelmatix/AnimatedGIFs/

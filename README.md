This code displays animated GIFs on a 64x16 RGB LED display. 
It was used to operate an LED Top Hat: https://imgur.com/gallery/6iKDv 

Minor modifications by: Matthew Varas

The program is based on previous modifications to the SmartMatrix3 "Animated GIFs" sketch.
Original modifications were by performed by Louis Beaudoin to adapt the sketch to the 
WS2812 NeoPixel using the Adafruit NeoPixel library. https://github.com/pixelmatix/animatedgifs/tree/neopixel 

Additional References: https://learn.adafruit.com/smartmatrix-animated-gif-player/overview 

The required additional libraries for the project are: 
    Adafruit_NeoPixel
    Adafruit_GFX
    Adafruit_NeoMatrix
 
 
The 64x16 top hat project used four 16x16 WS2812 RGB LED Matricies. The code was modified
to adjust for the different pixel layout and aspect ratio. All other code is original to 
the previous projects.

I'm not familiar with Git so I don't really understand how to fork(branch?) the existing projects, so they're listed in this ReadMe

GIF's are the property of their respective owners. I'm unsure of where many came from, but the following were from the PIXEL: LED Art project
